# Managing Dependencies

Object-oriented languages are efficient and effective because the model reality. Objects reflect real world problems and the interactions between those objects provide solutions. A single object cannot know everything, so it will have to talk to other objects.

For any desired behavior, an object knows it personally, inherits it, or knows another object who knows it. The previous chapter concerned itself with the behavior a class should implement personally. Behavior through inheritance is covered in one of the next chapters. This chapter will focus on getting access to behavior that is implemented in _other_ objects. 

Well build objects have a single responsibility. To solve complex tasks it is required that they work together. Tho collaborate, objects must know things about others. _Knowing_ creates dependencies. If not managed, dependencies will strangle your application.

## Understanding Dependencies

An object depends on another object if, when one object changes, the other might be forced to change in turn.

Here is a modified version of the `Gear` class. `Gear` is initialized with four familiar arguments. The `gear_inches` method uses both the `rim`and `tire` to create a new instance of `Wheel`. `Wheel` has not changed since the previous example.

```ruby
class Gear
  attr_reader :chainring, :cog, :rim, :tire
  def initialize(chainring, cog, rim, tire)
    @chainring = chainring
    @cog       = cog
    @rim       = rim
    @tire      = tire
  end

  def gear_inches
    ratio * Wheel.new(rim, tire).diameter
  end

  def ratio
    chainring / cog.to_f
  end
# ...
end

class Wheel
  attr_reader :rim, :tire
  def initialize(rim, tire)
    @rim       = rim
    @tire      = tire
  end

  def diameter
    rim + (tire * 2)
  end
# ...
end

Gear.new(52, 11, 26, 1.5).gear_inches
```

The code seems innocent, but it's a lot more complex than it looks. `Gear` has at least 4 dependencies on `Wheel`. Most of these dependencies are unnecessary. `Gear`does not need these dependencies to do the job. These dependencies resist change in the `Gear` implementation.

### Recognizing Dependencies

An object has dependencies when it knows

* The name of another class. `Gear`expects a class named `Wheel` to exist.
* The name of a message that it intends to send to someother than self. `Gear` expects a `Wheel` instance to respond to `diameter`.
* The arguments that a message requires. `Gear`knows that `Wheel.new` requires a `rim` and a `tire`.
* The order of those arguments. `Gear` knows the first argument to `Wheel.new` should be `rim`, the second, `tire`.

### Coupling Between Objects (CBO)


### Other Dependencies


## Writing Loosely Coupled Code


### Injecting Dependencies

```ruby
class Gear
  attr_reader :chainring, :cog, :rim, :tire
  def initialize(chainring, cog, rim, tire)
    @chainring = chainring
    @cog       = cog
    @rim       = rim
    @tire      = tire
  end

  def gear_inches
    ratio * Wheel.new(rim, tire).diameter
  end
# ...
end

Gear.new(52, 11, 26, 1.5).gear_inches
```

```ruby
class Gear
  attr_reader :chainring, :cog, :wheel
  def initialize(chainring, cog, wheel)
    @chainring = chainring
    @cog       = cog
    @wheel     = wheel
  end

  def gear_inches
    ratio * wheel.diameter
  end
# ...
end

# Gear expects a 'Duck' that knows 'diameter'
Gear.new(52, 11, Wheel.new(26, 1.5)).gear_inches
```

### Isolate Dependencies

```ruby
class Gear
  attr_reader :chainring, :cog, :rim, :tire, :wheel
  def initialize(chainring, cog, rim, tire)
    @chainring = chainring
    @cog       = cog
    @wheel     = Wheel.new(rim, tire)
  end

  def gear_inches
    ratio * wheel.diameter
  end
# ...
```

```ruby
class Gear
  attr_reader :chainring, :cog, :rim, :tire, :wheel
  def initialize(chainring, cog, rim, tire)
    @chainring = chainring
    @cog       = cog
    @rim       = rim
    @tire      = tire
  end

  def gear_inches
    ratio * wheel.diameter
  end

  def wheel
    @wheel ||= Wheel.new(rim, tire)
  end
# ...
```

```ruby
def gear_inches
  ratio * wheel.diameter
end
```

```ruby
def gear_inches
  #... a few lines of scary math
  foo = some_intermediate_result * wheel.diameter
  #... more lines of scary math
end
```

```ruby
def gear_inches
  #... a few lines of scary math
  foo = some_intermediate_result * diameter
  #... more lines of scary math
end

def diameter
  wheel.diameter
end
```

### Remove Argument-Order Dependencies

```ruby
class Gear
  attr_reader :chainring, :cog, :wheel
  def initialize(chainring, cog, wheel)
    @chainring = chainring
    @cog       = cog
    @wheel     = wheel
  end
  ...
end

Gear.new(
  52,
  11,
  Wheel.new(26, 1.5)).gear_inches
```

```ruby
class Gear
  attr_reader :chainring, :cog, :wheel
  def initialize(args)
    @chainring = args[:chainring]
    @cog       = args[:cog]
    @wheel     = args[:wheel]
  end
  ...
end

Gear.new(
  :chainring => 52,
  :cog       => 11,
  :wheel     => Wheel.new(26, 1.5)).gear_inches
```

```ruby
  # specifying defaults using ||
  def initialize(args)
    @chainring = args[:chainring] || 40
    @cog       = args[:cog]       || 18
    @wheel     = args[:wheel]
  end
```

```ruby
  # specifying defaults using fetch
  def initialize(args)
    @chainring = args.fetch(:chainring, 40)
    @cog       = args.fetch(:cog, 18)
    @wheel     = args[:wheel]
  end
```

```ruby
  # specifying defaults by merging a defaults hash
  def initialize(args)
    args = defaults.merge(args)
    @chainring = args[:chainring]
#   ...
  end

  def defaults
    {:chainring => 40, :cog => 18}
  end
```

```ruby
# When Gear is part of an external interface
module SomeFramework
  class Gear
    attr_reader :chainring, :cog, :wheel
    def initialize(chainring, cog, wheel)
      @chainring = chainring
      @cog       = cog
      @wheel     = wheel
    end
  # ...
  end
end

# wrap the interface to protect yourself from changes
module GearWrapper
  def self.gear(args)
    SomeFramework::Gear.new(args[:chainring],
                            args[:cog],
                            args[:wheel])
  end
end

# Now you can create a new Gear using an arguments hash.
GearWrapper.gear(
  :chainring => 52,
  :cog       => 11,
  :wheel     => Wheel.new(26, 1.5)).gear_inches
```

## Managing Dependency Direction


### Reversing Dependencies

```ruby
class Gear
  attr_reader :chainring, :cog
  def initialize(chainring, cog)
    @chainring = chainring
    @cog       = cog
  end

  def gear_inches(diameter)
    ratio * diameter
  end

  def ratio
    chainring / cog.to_f
  end
#  ...
end

class Wheel
  attr_reader :rim, :tire, :gear
  def initialize(rim, tire, chainring, cog)
    @rim       = rim
    @tire      = tire
    @gear      = Gear.new(chainring, cog)
  end

  def diameter
    rim + (tire * 2)
  end

  def gear_inches
    gear.gear_inches(diameter)
  end
#  ...
end

Wheel.new(26, 1.5, 52, 11).gear_inches
```
