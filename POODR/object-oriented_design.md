# Object-Oriented Design

The world is procedural. Time flows and events pass by one by one. Activities can be modeled using procedural software. The order is known so everything can be writen in code.

-- example --

The world is object-oriented. There are objects around us that we can interact with. Each object has its own behavior. Some interactions between objects might be predictable, others are not.

-- example -- 

In a world of objects, new arrangements of behavior emerge naturally. Object-oriented design requires you to shift your thinking of the world as a collection of predefined procedures to modeling the world as a series of messages that pass between objects.
