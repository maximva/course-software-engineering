#### Links

**Redmine links**

Redmine allows hyperlinking between resources \(issues, changesets, wiki pages...\) from anywhere wiki formatting is used.

* Link to an issue:

  **\#124**

  \(displays

  [~~\#124~~](https://project.labict.be/help/en/wiki_syntax_detailed_markdown.html#)

  , link is striked-through if the issue is closed\)

* Link to an issue note:

  **\#124-6**

  , or

  **\#124\#note-6**

Wiki links:

* **\[\[Guide\]\]**

  displays a link to the page named 'Guide':

  [Guide](https://project.labict.be/help/en/wiki_syntax_detailed_markdown.html#)

* **\[\[Guide\#further-reading\]\]**

  takes you to the anchor "further-reading". Headings get automatically assigned anchors so that you can refer to them:

  [Guide](https://project.labict.be/help/en/wiki_syntax_detailed_markdown.html#)

* **\[\[Guide\|User manual\]\]**

  displays a link to the same page but with a different text:

  [User manual](https://project.labict.be/help/en/wiki_syntax_detailed_markdown.html#)

You can also link to pages of an other project wiki:

* **\[\[sandbox:some page\]\]**

  displays a link to the page named 'Some page' of the Sandbox wiki

* **\[\[sandbox:\]\]**

  displays a link to the Sandbox wiki main page

Wiki links are displayed in red if the page doesn't exist yet, eg:[Nonexistent page](https://project.labict.be/help/en/wiki_syntax_detailed_markdown.html#).

Escaping:

* You can prevent Redmine links from being parsed by preceding them with an exclamation mark: !

**Externe links**

HTTP URLs and email addresses are automatically turned into clickable links:

```text
http://www.redmine.org, someone@foo.bar
```

displays: [http://www.redmine.org](http://www.redmine.org/),[someone@foo.bar](mailto:someone@foo.bar)

If you want to display a specific text instead of the URL, you can use the standard markdown syntax:

```text
[Redmine web site](http://www.redmine.org)
```

displays: [Redmine web site](http://www.redmine.org/)

**Text formatting**

For things such as headlines, bold, tables, lists, Redmine supports Markdown syntax. See [http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) for information on using any of these features. A few samples are included below, but the engine is capable of much more of that.

#### Font style

```text
* **bold**
* *Italic*
* ***bold italic***
* ~~strike-through~~
```

Display:

* **bold**
* _italic_
* _**bold italic**_
* ~~strike-through~~

#### Inline images

* **!\[\]\(image\_url\)**  displays an image located at image\_url \(markdown syntax\)
* If you have an image attached to your wiki page, it can be displayed inline using its filename:  **!\[\]\(attached\_image\)**

#### Headings

```text
# Heading
## Subheading
### Subsubheading
```

Redmine assigns an anchor to each of those headings thus you can link to them with "\#Heading", "\#Subheading" and so forth.

#### Blockquotes

Start the paragraph with**&gt;**

```text
>
 Rails is a full-stack framework for developing database-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Control pattern.
To go live, all you need to add is a database and a web server.
```

Display:

> Rails is a full-stack framework for developing database-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Control pattern.  
> To go live, all you need to add is a database and a web server.

#### Table of content

```text
{{toc}} =
>
 left aligned toc
{{
>
toc}} =
>
 right aligned toc
```

#### Horizontal Rule

```text
---
```

**Macros**

Redmine has the following builtin macros:

`hello_world`

Sample macro.

`macro_list`

Displays a list of all available macros, including description if available.

`child_pages`

Displays a list of child pages. With no argument, it displays the child pages of the current wiki page. Examples:

```text
{{child_pages}} -- can be used from a wiki page only
{{child_pages(depth=2)}} -- display 2 levels nesting only
```

`include`

Include a wiki page. Example:

```text
{{include(Foo)}}
```

or to include a page of a specific project wiki:

```text
{{include(projectname:Foo)}}
```

`collapse`

Inserts of collapsed block of text. Example:

```text
{{collapse(View details...)
This is a block of text that is collapsed by default.
It can be expanded by clicking a link.
}}
```

`thumbnail`

Displays a clickable thumbnail of an attached image. Examples:

```text
{{thumbnail(image.png)}}
{{thumbnail(image.png, size=300, title=Thumbnail)}}
```

**Code highlighting**

Default code highlightment relies on [CodeRay](http://coderay.rubychan.de/), a fast syntax highlighting library written completely in Ruby. It currently supports c, clojure, cpp \(c++, cplusplus\), css, delphi \(pascal\), diff \(patch\), erb \(eruby, rhtml\), go, groovy, haml, html \(xhtml\), java, javascript \(ecmascript, ecma\_script, java\_script, js\), json, lua, php, python, ruby \(irb\), sass, sql, taskpaper, text \(plain, plaintext\), xml and yaml \(yml\) languages, where the names inside parentheses are aliases.

You can highlight code at any place that supports wiki formatting using this syntax \(note that the language name or alias is case-insensitive\):

```text
~~~ ruby
  Place your code here.
~~~
```

Example:

```ruby
# The Greeter class
class Greeter

  def initialize (name
    @name = name.capitalize
  end

  def salute
    puts "Hello #{@name}!"
  end

end
```
