# Open Source Licences

Choose an open source license

An open source license protects contributors and users. Businesses and savvy developers won’t touch a project without this protection.

## I need to work in a community

 Use the [license preferred by the community](https://choosealicense.com/community/) you’re contributing to or depending on. Your project will fit right in.

If you have a dependency that doesn’t have a license, ask its maintainers to add a license.

## I want it simple and permissive

The [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) is short and to the point.
It lets people do almost anything they want with your project, like making and distributing closed source versions.

Babel, .NET Core, and Rails use the MIT License.

## I care about sharing improvements

The [GNU GPLv3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) also lets people do almost anything they want with your project,
except distributing closed source versions.

Ansible, Bash, and GIMP use the GNU GPLv3.
