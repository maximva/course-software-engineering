## Test Driven Development - TDD

RED - GREEN - REFACTOR


### Three laws of TDD

**First Law**: You may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test.

**Second Law**: You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail.

**Third Law**: You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test.
